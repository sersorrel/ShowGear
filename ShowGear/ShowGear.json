  "Punchline": "Shows your gear in the Fitting Room by default.",
  "Description": "Normally the Fitting Room defaults to showing you just the piece of gear you’re trying on. This plugin inverts that behaviour: when you launch the game, the Fitting Room (and Item Dyeing) will show all your gear by default.\n\nNB: there are some oddities to how Item Dyeing behaves when this plugin is doing its thing. If you’d rather it not touch Item Dyeing at all, there’s an option for that (and more details about the problem) in the settings.",
